#  Seeking help

There are various ways to seek help on R.

If you are searching for help on a specific function that is in a package loaded into your namespace:

```
?function_name
help(function_name)
```
--

For example 

```{r}
?lm
help(lm)
```

--

To see documentation explicitly, use help() with the function name and package name.

```
help(adf.test, package="tseries")
```

---

#  Seeking help

If you're not sure what package it belongs to:

```
??function_name
```

```{r}
??regressiom
```

--

Search for key words or phrases in help pages, vignettes or task views, using the search engine at http://search.r-project.org and view them in a web browser.

```
RSiteSearch("pca")
```
---

#  Run Example

Run an Examples of specific function

```
example(functionname)
```

Try

```
example(sum)
```

```
sum> ## Pass a vector to sum, and it will add the elements together.
sum> sum(1:5)
[1] 15
```

--

You can see a list of vignettes on your computer by using vignette()

```
vignette()
```

You can see the vignettes for a particular package by including its name

```
vignette(package="beanplot")
```

---

# Rdocumentation

# R Objects

To make the best of the R language, you'll need a strong understanding of the basic data types and data structures and how to operate on those.

Everything in **R** is an object.

--

`R` has 6 atomic classes.

* character
* numeric (real or decimal)
* integer
* logical
* complex

---

# Find Data type

```{r, eval = FALSE}
typeof() # what is it?
length() # how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
attributes() # does it have any metadata?

# Example

x = "dataset"
typeof(x)
attributes(x)

y = 1:10
typeof(y)
length(y)
attributes(y)

z = c(1L, 2L, 3L)
typeof(z)
```

---

# Data Structure

R has many data structures. These include

* atomic vector
* list
* matrix
* data frame
* factors
* tables

--

A vector is the most common and basic data structure in `R` and is pretty much the workhorse of R. Technically, vectors can be one of two types:
A vector can be a vector of elements that are most commonly **character**, **logical**, **integer** or **numeric**.

You can create an empty vector with `vector()`

---

# Vector

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = vector() # with a length and type
vector("character", length = 10)
character(5) # character vector of length 5
numeric(5)
logical(5)
```

--

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = c(1, 2, 3)
x
```

---

# Vector

`x` is a numeric vector. These are the most common kind. They are numeric objects and are treated as double precision real numbers. To explicitly create integers, add an `L` at the end.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x1 = c(1L, 2L, 3L)
```

You can also have logical vectors. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
y = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```

Finally you can have character vectors:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
z = c("Alec", "Dan", "Rob", "Karthik")
```

---

# Vector

Examine your vector  

```{r, eval = TRUE}
typeof(z)
length(z)
class(z)
str(z)
```

---

# Vector

More examples of vectors

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = c(0.5, 0.7)
x = c(TRUE, FALSE)
x = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
x = 9:100
x = c(1+0i, 2+4i)
```

You can also create vectors as a sequence of numbers

```{r, eval = TRUE}
series = 1:10
seq(10)
seq(1, 10, by = 1)
```

---

# Other objects

`Inf` is infinity. You can have either positive or negative infinity.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
1/0
1/Inf
```


`NaN` means Not a number. It's an undefined value.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
0/0
```

---

# Object attributes

Each object can have attributes. Attribues can be part of an object of 
R. These include: 

* names
* dimnames
* dim
* class
* attributes (contain metadata)

---

# Change data type 

You can also coerce vectors explicitly using the `as.<class_name>`. Example

When you coerce an existing numeric vector with `as.numeric()`, it converts the vector to a double.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x <- 0:6
identical(x, as.numeric(x))
typeof(x)
typeof(as.numeric(x))
```

---

# Change data type 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x <- 0:6
as.numeric(x)
as.logical(x) 
as.character(x)
as.complex(x) 
```

---

# Matrix

Matrices are a special vector in R. They are not a separate type of object but simply an atomic vector with dimensions added on to it. Matrices have rows and columns. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
m = matrix(nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m
dim(m)
```

---

# Matrix

Matrices are filled column-wise. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
m = matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

Other ways to construct a matrix

```{r, eval = TRUE}
m = 1:10
dim(m) = c(2, 5)
```

--

You can also use the `byrow` argument to specify how the matrix is filled. From R's own documentation:

```{r, eval = TRUE, tidy = FALSE}
mdat = matrix(c(1,2,3, 11,12,13), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE,
               dimnames = list(c("row1", "row2"),
                               c("C.1", "C.2", "C.3")))
mdat
```

---

# List

A list is a special type of vector. Each element can be a different type.

Create lists using `list()` or coerce other objects using `as.list()`

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = list(1, "a", TRUE, 1+4i)
x
```

---

# List

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x = 1:10
x = as.list(x)
length(x)
```

Different type of list

```{r, eval = TRUE}
xlist = list(a = "Karthik Ram", b = 1:10, data = iris[1:2,])
xlist
```

---

# List

A list can contain many lists nested inside.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
temp = list(list(list(list())))
temp
is.recursive(temp)
```

Lists are extremely useful inside functions. You can "staple" together lots of different kinds of results into a single object that a function can return.

---

# Factors

Factors are special vectors that represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or unordered and are important when for modelling functions such as `lm()` and `glm()` and also in plot methods.

Factors can only contain pre-defined values.

Factors are pretty much integers that have labels on them.  While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them like strings. Some string methods will coerce factors to strings, while others will throw an error.

--

Sometimes factors can be left unordered. Example: `male`, `female`.

Other times you might want factors to be ordered (or ranked). Example: `low`, `medium`, `high`. 

Underlying it's represented by numbers 1, 2, 3.

---

# Factors

Factors can be created with `factor()`. Input is generally a character vector.

```{r}
x = factor(c("yes", "no", "no", "yes", "yes"))
x
```

`table(x)` will return a frequency table.

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, simply use

```{r}
as.character(x)
```

---

# Factors

In modeling functions, it is important to know what the baseline level is.
This is the first factor but by default the ordering is determined by alphabetical order of words entered. You can change this by speciying the levels (another option is to use the function `relevel`).

```{r}
x = factor(c("yes", "no", "yes"), levels = c("yes", "no"))
x
```

---

# Data frame

A data frame is a very important data type in R. It's pretty much the *de facto* data structure for most tabular data and what we use for statistics.

Data frames can have additional attributes such as `rownames()`, which can be useful for annotating data, like subject_id or sample_id. But most of the time they are not used.

--

Some additional information on data frames:

* Usually created by `read.csv()` and `read.table()`.

* Can convert to `matrix` with `data.matrix()`

* Can also create with `data.frame()` function.

* Find the number of rows and columns with `nrow(df)` and `ncol(df)`, respectively.

---

# Data frame

You create a data frame using `data.frame()`, which takes named vectors as input:

```{r}
df = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
str(df)
```

--

Beware `data.frame()`'s default behaviour which turns strings into factors. Use `stringAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this behaviour: 

```{r}
df = data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(df)
```

---

# Combining data frames

```{r, eval = TRUE}
df = data.frame(id = letters[1:5], x = 1:5, y = rnorm(5))
df
cbind(df, data.frame(z = 4))
```

---

# Useful functions

* `head()` - see first 6 rows
* `tail()` - see last 6 rows
* `dim()` - see dimensions
* `nrow()` - number of rows
* `ncol()` - number of columns
* `str()` - structure of each column
* `names()` - will list the `names` attribute for a data frame (or any object really), which gives the column names.

A data frame is a special type of list where every element of the list has same length.
